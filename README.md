Running Ruby on Windows.
I came across several solutions to this problem.
1. Comment out a line in application.js in vendor directory
2. Edit ExecJS in vendor directory
3. Editing a views.html.erb file
4. Install NodeJS
5. Perhaps writing a C extension.
6. Don't run Ruby on Windows.

I did the Cheap solution, i.e., #3.
