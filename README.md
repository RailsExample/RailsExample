Running Ruby on Windows. </br>
I came across several solutions to this problem. </br>
1. Comment out a line in application.js in vendor directory </br>
2. Edit ExecJS in vendor directory </br>
3. Editing a views.html.erb file </br>
4. Install NodeJS </br>
5. Perhaps writing a C extension. </br>
6. Don't run Ruby on Windows. </br>
